The team members are:

* **[@rockbot](https://github.com/rockbot/)** (tech lead)

## What This Repo Is

If there are major releases going out, we will write them up here.

We will collect documentation about API endpoints here.

:white_check_mark: If you are having issues with the website — it loads
too slow, or if you can't see a page you know exists, or complete a task you know is possible — **please open an
issue here**. If the topic is sensitive, please [contact
support](https://www.npmjs.com/support).

:white_check_mark: If you need something from the website — a new feature, or improvements in an
existing feature — **please open an issue here**. We will take the feature under
consideration: keep in mind, we often have to pass on really good ideas due to
time constraints. Wherever we can, we'll try to make your feature possible.

:warning: This team does not enforce **policy**. If you are interested in the
policies of npm, please look at the [policies
repository](https://github.com/npm/policies).

:no_entry: This repository is **not** the place to bring package disputes.

## What The Web Team's Goals Are

1. **Teach people about javascript development** The website is often people's first introduction to npm. This means we work to help people build a mental model of how npm works and how it fits into their toolchain.
2. **Help users get a 10,000 foot view of their modules, organization, and teams**. A CLI is great for getting tasks done, a website excels at letting users understand the big picture. The goal of the website is to allow users to easily manage their teams, permissions, and packages.
3. **Develop features that help us keep running the registry**.
   This includes both free features and for-pay features — sometimes this will
   involve working with the Enterprise team to develop public registry features
   that add value to the enterprise product, sometimes this will involve building
   features for private modules users.
